      a. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
      b. Clear npm cache
      c. Reinstall dependencies
      d. Commit changes and redeploy
    - Keep track of deployment issues and resolutions in error_log.txt

Deployment:
- The app is deployed on Heroku
- The app name is 'blendr'
- The app URL is https://blendr-4c514d99c8e5.herokuapp.com/
- This URL includes a unique identifier assigned by Heroku and cannot be changed

Heroku Deployment Steps:
1. Ensure you're logged in to Heroku CLI: heroku login
2. Set up the Heroku remote: heroku git:remote -a blendr
3. Push changes to Heroku: git push heroku main
4. Open the app in browser: heroku open
5. Check logs for any issues: heroku logs --tail

Git Configuration:
- Email: mreoch82@hotmail.com
- Username: Mreoch1

To set up Git configuration:
git config --global user.email "mreoch82@hotmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Mreoch1"

Note: As of the last deployment, there was a warning about a Heroku CLI update available. Consider updating the Heroku CLI to the latest version (9.3.0 or newer) for optimal performance and features.
